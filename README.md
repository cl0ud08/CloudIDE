## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

CloudIDE is designed to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. The `k8s` directory contains the necessary YAML files to deploy the application.

1.  **Build and push the Docker images** for each service (frontend, orchestrator-simple, runner, init-service) to a container registry.
2.  **Configure the `k8s/deployment.yaml`** file with the correct image names and any other necessary environment variables.
3.  **Apply the Kubernetes configurations**:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/
    ```

For more detailed deployment instructions, refer to the `DEPLOY.md` file.
